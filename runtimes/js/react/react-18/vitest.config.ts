/**
 * @glossa/react's own test files, run against React 18.3 instead of 19.
 *
 * A package of its own because pnpm resolves `react-dom`'s peer `react` from
 * the depending package: in @glossa/react an aliased `react-dom@18` would
 * still get React 19. Here both are 18.3, and the aliases point the tests'
 * and the sources' `react` / `react-dom` imports at them.
