// @vitest-environment node
/**
 * The M3 exit test's fixture application is built here and committed
 * into the Go tree (scripts/m3-fixture.mjs), so
 * platform/internal/systemtest/m3 needs no Node. This test rebuilds it
 * and fails when the committed output no longer matches the sources
 * `go generate ./internal/systemtest/m3/...` writes — the exit test must
 * never run on a stale bundle or on stale usages.
 *
 * It is the same contract @glossa/capture keeps for the capture agent it
 * bundles into the CLI. The two usages documents are compared exactly;
 * the bundles are compared by what the exit test reads from them — every
 * message of the application, and the loader's markers — because a
 * bundler's output is not byte-identical across the environments that
 * write and check it.
