// The M3 exit test's fixture application, built for real (RFC 0004 §12).
//
// `pnpm --filter @glossa/unplugin build:m3` runs three Vite builds of
// platform/internal/systemtest/m3/testdata/app — the app `go generate
// ./internal/systemtest/m3/...` writes — and puts what the Go test needs
// beside it:
//
//   built/preview/      the app as a preview deployment: the overlay
//                       loader is in it, and `glossa capture` drives it
//   built/production/   the same app built for production: no loader
//   usages.json         what @glossa/unplugin saw in the preview build
//   usages.branch.json  the same, with the pull request's checkout page
//
// src/m3-fixture.test.ts fails when a checked-in file differs from a
// fresh build, so the exit test never runs on a stale bundle.
