# @glossa/unplugin

Finds where every message is used in a web build: file, line, column,
component and route. One core on [`unplugin`](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin)
serves Vite, Rollup, webpack and esbuild; Astro gets it from
[`@glossa/astro`](../astro). The build writes `.glossa/usages.json`
(`glossa.usages/v1`, [RFC 0004 §2](../../../docs/rfcs/0004-context.md)) and
`glossa context push .glossa/usages.json` uploads it. That's how a
translator learns where a string appears.

The plugin **never makes network calls** and never changes your code, except
to add the in-product editor's loader to builds for a non-production Glossa
environment ([below](#the-in-product-editors-loader)). It needs no
credentials, and builds stay reproducible.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue";
import glossa from "@glossa/unplugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    vue(),
    glossa({
      application: "web",
      keys: () => Object.keys(JSON.parse(readFileSync("locales/en.json", "utf8"))),
      routes: { "/checkout/payment": ["src/checkout/**"] },
    }),
  ],
});
```

```jsonc
// .glossa/usages.json
{
  "schema": "glossa.usages/v1",
  "application": "web",
  "commit": "9f2c1e7…", "branch": "feat/checkout-copy",
  "tool": { "name": "@glossa/unplugin", "version": "0.1.0" },
  "usages": [
    { "key": "checkout.pay", "file": "src/checkout/PaymentFooter.vue", "line": 42, "column": 9,
      "component": "PaymentFooter", "kind": "t" }
  ]
}
```

The other bundlers import from `@glossa/unplugin/rollup`,
`@glossa/unplugin/webpack` and `@glossa/unplugin/esbuild`.

## Options

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `application` | the root package.json's name as a slug (`@acme/web` → `web`) | The application's slug in the Glossa project. |
| `commit` | `GITHUB_SHA`, else `git rev-parse HEAD` | Full commit ID. On `pull_request` events `GITHUB_SHA` is the merge commit; pass `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` to tie usages to the head. |
| `branch` | `GITHUB_HEAD_REF`, else `GITHUB_REF_NAME` (branch refs), else the checked-out branch | Short branch name. |
| `outDir` | `.glossa/` beside the build output (`dist/` → `.glossa/`) | Where `usages.json` goes, relative to `root`. Keep it outside anything you serve. |
| `root` | Vite's `root`, webpack's `context`, esbuild's `absWorkingDir`, else the working directory | `file` paths are relative to it. Files outside it and in `node_modules` aren't reported. |
| `keys` | none | The catalog's message keys, or a function returning them. They name the typed accessors from `glossa generate`; without them accessor calls aren't reported, every other shape is. |
| `routes` | none | Route pattern → root-relative globs (`**` crosses directories, `*` doesn't). The first matching entry names a usage's route. Astro's `src/pages/**` routes need no entry. |
| `usages` | `true` | `false` writes no `usages.json`, for a build that only wants the overlay loader. |
| `environment` | none | The Glossa environment the build is deployed to (`production`, `preview`, `pr-7`…). The overlay loader needs it. |
| `overlay` | on when `environment` is set and isn't `production` | Add the in-product editor's loader. `true` with `environment: "production"` fails the build; `false` leaves it out. |
| `studio` | none; required while `overlay` is on | `{ origin, integrity, tenant, project, api? }`: Studio's origin, the overlay script's SRI hash from Studio's `/overlay/v1/overlay.json`, the tenant and project IDs, and the API origin when it isn't Studio's. |

When the build can't be named (no application, commit or branch, say in a
tarball without git), the plugin warns and writes nothing: the document
requires all three.

## What counts as a usage

The contract is the shared fixture suite in
[`runtimes/testdata/usages`](../../testdata/usages/README.md), which
`glossa extract` passes too. In short:

- `t("…")`, `$t("…")` and any `.t("…")`/`.$t("…")` call (kind `t`)
- `<T id="…">` (React) and `<GlossaText id="…">` (Vue) (kind `component`)
- `<glossa-text|rich|plural|select>` with `key="…"` or `message="…"`; `key` wins (kind `element`)
- the typed accessors `glossa generate` writes: `m.checkout.pay(…)` (kind `accessor`)

Only literal keys count, and only valid message keys. A variable, a
concatenation or a template literal with `${}` is dynamic and never
reported, so unused messages are reported, never deleted. Comments,
strings, JSX and HTML text, other components and generated files
(`// Code generated … DO NOT EDIT.` on the first line) never count.

- **Component**: the `.vue` or `.astro` file name, or for JSX/TSX the
  nearest enclosing capitalized function (declaration, named function
  expression, or arrow assigned to a `const`) or class.
- **Route**: Astro's `src/pages/**` path, else the `routes` option.
- **Position**: 1-based line, and a 1-based column in Unicode code points
  that points at the first character of the key inside its quotes (an
  accessor's first path segment).
- **Order**: by key, file, line and column, strings by code point.

## How it works, per bundler

The plugin reads each module **after** the framework transforms, so it sees
what the bundler sees: Vue templates as render functions, `.astro` markup as
`$$renderComponent` calls, JSX as `jsx()`/`createElement()` calls, TypeScript
stripped. It parses that code into an ESTree AST, finds the call shapes
above, and maps every hit back to the original file through the module's
source map. Source maps are only as fine as their producers make them (Vue
maps a template expression, not the string inside it), so the mapped
position is then pinned to the key itself in the original text: the exact
spot when the producer copied the text verbatim, else the nearest matching
key after the mapped position. Each original position is used once per
module.

| Bundler | Runs | Parser | Source map |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vite (and Astro) | `enforce: "post"`, builds only (`apply: "build"`) | Vite's `this.parse` | `this.getCombinedSourcemap()`. The plugin asks `@vitejs/plugin-vue` for SFC source maps even when `build.sourcemap` is off; this doesn't change the bundle. HTML entries are read in `transformIndexHtml`, as written. |
| Rollup | where you list it: put it **after** the plugins that compile TS, JSX or SFCs | Rollup's `this.parse` | `this.getCombinedSourcemap()` |
| webpack 5 | as a post loader, after your loaders | acorn | the incoming loader map (the plugin still works when a loader emits none, by searching from the same line) |
| esbuild | its own `onLoad`, which returns nothing: list it **first** | acorn | esbuild plugins see files before esbuild compiles them, so the plugin strips TS/JSX with esbuild's `transform` and reads that map. `.vue`/`.astro` files need Vite. |

Only Vite reads HTML files. The usages of every build environment (Astro's
server, prerender and client builds, Vite's SSR build) are merged into one
document, which is rewritten after each bundle is written. Separate
`vite build` processes (say, client then `--ssr`) don't share one: the
last overwrites it, so give each its own `outDir` and push both.

## The in-product editor's loader

Translators edit a running preview of the product through the overlay
([RFC 0004 §5](../../../docs/rfcs/0004-context.md)), which Studio serves.
A build for a preview environment gets a small loader for it
([`@glossa/runtime/dev`](../runtime/README.md#glossaruntimedev-the-overlay-loader));
a production build never does. Three layers keep it out of production:

1. **Build time (this plugin).** The loader is added only when
   `environment` is set and isn't `production`, whatever Vite's `mode` (static
   previews are built in production mode too). `overlay: true` with
   `environment: "production"` throws before the build starts, and so does an
   overlay without `environment` or `studio`.
2. **Runtime.** The loader does nothing until `?glossa=edit` or Alt+Shift+E,
   and then only if every runtime on the page has loaded a release whose
   (signed) manifest `environment` isn't `production`.
3. **Delivery.** The overlay itself comes from Studio
   (`/overlay/v1/overlay.js`), pinned by the SRI hash you give here, so a
   production page's CSP never allows it.

```ts
// vite.config.ts of a preview deployment
glossa({
  environment: process.env.GLOSSA_ENVIRONMENT, // "preview", "pr-7"… or "production"
  studio: {
    origin: "https://studio.example.com",
    integrity: "sha384-…", // from https://studio.example.com/overlay/v1/overlay.json
    tenant: "ten_…",
    project: "prj_…",
  },
});
```

The hash is an option, not fetched: the build stays offline and
deterministic. When Studio ships a new overlay (its `overlay.json` has a new
`version` and `integrity`), update the pin; until then the browser refuses the
new script and the loader says so on the console.

How the loader gets into the build (it needs no particular order: runtimes
list themselves on the page, so it finds them whenever it runs):

| Bundler | How |
|---|---|
| Vite | A `<script type="module">` for `virtual:glossa/overlay-loader` at the top of every HTML entry, bundled like your own scripts: no inline code for a CSP to allow. Works in `vite dev` too. |
| Astro | [`@glossa/astro`](../astro/README.md) imports it in a page script. |
| Rollup, Rolldown | An import appended to every entry module (appended, so no line moves). |
| webpack | A global entry, which webpack adds to every entrypoint. |
| esbuild | `inject`. |

webpack and esbuild take the loader as a file: it's written to
`node_modules/.cache/glossa/`, beside a `package.json` that marks it as having
side effects.

Per-route chunking waits for namespace routing in the SPEC.

## Development

```bash
pnpm --filter @glossa/unplugin test
```

`test/fixtures.test.ts` runs every fixture case marked for `unplugin`
through a real `vite build` (and `vite build --ssr` for Vue, `astro build`
for Astro), the TS/TSX cases also through Rollup, esbuild and webpack, and
checks each `usages.json` against the JSON Schema and `expected.json`.
`test/overlay.test.ts` builds a small app with Vite, Rollup, webpack and
esbuild and scans the output: a preview build has the loader, a production
build (or one without `environment`) has neither the loader nor the Studio
overlay URL, and `overlay: true` in production fails.
