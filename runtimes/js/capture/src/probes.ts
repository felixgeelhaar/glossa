/**
 * The visual probe pass (RFC 0005 §5): semantic assertions about known
 * regions, measured live in the page while the capture session is open,
 * because `scrollWidth`, `getComputedStyle`, `document.fonts.check()` and
 * `explain()` exist only while the page is open. No pixel diffing, no OCR, no
 * contrast, no screenshot ever read back (RFC 0005 §5.3).
 *
 * Each probe emits the one finding shape (RFC 0005 §2.1,
 * runtimes/testdata/schemas/finding.v1.schema.json) at layer `visual`, always
 * at severity `warning`: promotion to `error` needs the same fingerprint in
 * two consecutive captures, which only the server can see (§5.2). Two fields
 * of that shape are deliberately absent, because the page cannot know them
 * and a guess would be worse than a gap:
 *
 * - `fingerprint` hashes the **catalog message ID** where the caller has one
 *   (`platform/internal/quality/domain.Fingerprint`), and a browser never has
 *   one — it has the key. A fingerprint computed here would not be the one
 *   the server computes for the same finding, so waivers would stop matching.
 * - `locus.capture` is the capture's ID, minted on ingest. A probe names the
 *   region within this capture (`r_<index into regions>`) and the ingest
 *   fills the capture in — exactly as RFC 0005 §2.1 has Context fill a locus
 *   at report time.
 *
 * Everything else — `schema`, `layer`, `code`, `severity`, `locus.key`,
 * `locus.locale`, `locus.region`, `message`, `subject`, `evidence` — is the
 * wire shape verbatim.
