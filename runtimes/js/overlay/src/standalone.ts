 * The script Studio serves at `/overlay/v1/overlay.js` (RFC 0004 §5.1),

 * `dist/bundle/overlay.js`. Running it defines `<glossa-overlay>` and hands
 * `activate` to the overlay loader (`@glossa/runtime/dev`), which added this
 * script with its SRI hash after checking the page's runtimes. It's a
 * module script, so the handover goes through a well-known symbol rather
