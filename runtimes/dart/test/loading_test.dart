/// The runtime contract's loading fixtures (`runtimes/SPEC.md` §1.3, §3,
/// §7), driven exactly as the JS driver
/// (`runtimes/js/runtime/src/contract.test.ts`) and the Go driver
/// (`runtimes/go/conformance_test.go`) drive them.
///
/// Every `runtimes/testdata/loading/*.json` file is one sequence. Each step
/// puts the step's responses behind a fake edge, settles one load — a fresh
/// [GlossaClient] on the first step and at every `restartBefore` index,
/// which drops memory and keeps the persisted store, `refresh()` otherwise
/// — and then reads. The step asserts the whole contract: the rendered
/// string, the active release afterwards, `explain().source`, and the error
/// types emitted during the step, in order. A `304` step also asserts that
/// the revalidation carried the previous `ETag` as `If-None-Match`.
///
/// [_skips] below names the loading cases this runtime doesn't pass yet:
/// only the staged-rollout sequences that put an installation on the
/// candidate (SPEC §1.4), which the Dart runtime implements in RFC 0006
/// wave 3. Any other entry would mean Dart disagrees with the contract, and
/// that is a bug, not a configuration. The group `the skip list is honest`
/// fails if an entry ever goes stale, so the list cannot quietly rot.
