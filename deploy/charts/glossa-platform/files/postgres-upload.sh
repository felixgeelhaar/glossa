# whole, then applies retention to this release's own dump files only.

# Environment (set by the chart):
#   RCLONE_CONFIG    rclone.conf (from backup.rclone.configSecretName)
#   IN_DIR           the scratch volume with dump.name and the dump
#   REMOTE           <remote>:<directory>, never a remote's root
#   PREFIX           dump file prefix
#   RETENTION_DAYS   dumps older than this are deleted
