# checks what row level security depends on:
#   - glossa_app logs in with the password from postgres.app,
#   - it is not a superuser, BYPASSRLS, CREATEROLE or CREATEDB role,
#   - it cannot SET ROLE to any role that is (the superuser, the owner,
#     the backup role),
#   - it can SET ROLE glossa_system, as the server's system scope must.
# Read-only: it changes nothing.
#
# Environment: PGHOST, PGPORT, PGDATABASE, PGUSER (glossa_app), PGPASSWORD.
