// that says a different thing about a different layer, code, locale,
// namespace or environment, instead of one severity for the whole
// project.
//
// A rule is a selector plus what to do with what it selects. The
// selector is a subset of five fields; every field it names must match,
// and every field it leaves out matches anything. The evaluation is
// pure: given a Target — what a layer found, and where — the policy
// answers with a Decision, which is the severity the finding has here,
// whether it can fail the run, and which rule said so. "Why did this
// fail?" has a mechanical answer (§4.3).

// Mode is what a rule's severity is allowed to do to a run.
