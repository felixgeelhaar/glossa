// Package domain is the Quality context's model (RFC 0005 §2): one
// finding, wherever it comes from.
//
// Before M4 a finding had seven shapes — messageformat.Finding,
// Localization's stored warnings, Knowledge's and Intelligence's
// TermFinding, cli/terminology.Finding, cli/qa.Finding and
// integration/app.CheckFinding — and every conversion between them
// dropped something: the byte spans on the way to the CLI, the subject
// and the qualifier on the way to the server, the file and the line
// almost everywhere. RFC 0005 §14 decision 1 replaces all seven with
// this one, so the terminal, the pull request and the server cannot
// disagree about what was found or where.
//
// The type carries no behaviour beyond its identity: a layer says what
// is wrong with which message in which locale, and Context fills the
// locus's file, line, route and component in at report time.
