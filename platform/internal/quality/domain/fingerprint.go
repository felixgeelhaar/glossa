// FingerprintPrefix marks a fingerprint in logs, waivers and the wire.
const FingerprintPrefix = "f_"

// Fingerprint identifies a finding: the same problem keeps the same
// fingerprint across re-runs, across `glossa check`, the PR check and
// the server job, and across edits that have nothing to do with it.
//
// It hashes exactly five things, and nothing else:
//
//   - the layer,
//   - the code,
//   - the message the finding is about — its catalog ID where the
//     caller has one, and its key where it does not (an offline
//     `glossa check` never has an ID),
//   - the locale, and
//   - the normalized subject: the argument, markup element or term the
//     finding names, NFC-normalized, trimmed and with internal
//     whitespace collapsed.
//
// What it deliberately leaves out is the point (RFC 0005 §2.1):
//
//   - the file, the line and the column, so reformatting a file or
//     moving a component does not re-open every waiver,
//   - the source revision, which invalidates waivers on its own terms
//     (§2.3) and must not silently mint new findings,
//   - the human message, the qualifier, the evidence and the fix, so
//     rewording an explanation — or rewording an unrelated message in
//     the same project — churns nothing,
//   - the severity, so tightening a policy does not orphan a waiver.
//
// Two distinct problems in one message stay distinct because the
// subject distinguishes them: two missing arguments are two findings.
//
// It generalizes domain.AnnotationFingerprint, which the PR check
// computes over (path, line, message) for a different job — not sending
// GitHub an annotation it already has — and which RFC 0005 §13 wave 4
// replaces when the PR check moves onto the layered report.

// The server always has the ID, so a rename never re-opens its

// carries no message IDs — and there a rename is a new finding, which
// is the honest answer locally: nobody holds a waiver offline.

// case-bearing and "Login" is not "login" to a termbase.
