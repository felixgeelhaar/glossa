// Package review is the seam between a linguistic-QA job and the
// linguistic layer (RFC 0005 §3.8, §13 wave 6).
//
// The two wave-6 slices meet here and nowhere else. The **job** thinks
// in scopes and batches: it asks for "de and fr under `checkout`, on
// `main`", hands the request over and follows a handle. The **layer**
// thinks in one translation: it is given a message, a locale, the two
// texts and the knowledge that bears on them, and answers with what a
// model suspects. Neither is wrong; one is asynchronous and plural and
// the other is synchronous and singular, and something has to expand
// the first into the second.
//
// That is this package's whole job:
//
//   - **Expansion.** The scope becomes a list of (message, locale)
//     pairs, read through ports from the contexts that own the data —
//     Catalog for the messages, their namespaces and their descriptions;
//     Localization for the translations and the revisions a finding is
//     pinned to; Knowledge for the recognized terms and the effective
//     style guide. Quality reads no other context's tables (RFC 0002 §4).
//   - **The `sensitive` rule, absolutely.** A pair under a namespace the
//     job excluded is never enqueued, so no provider is ever offered it,
//     and it is counted into SkippedSensitive rather than quietly
//     dropped: a reviewer has to know the layer did not look there.
//   - **The message ID.** The layer refuses a request without one and is
//     right to: the fingerprint is hashed over it, and an identity
//     minted over a key is not the one every other surface computes
//     (RFC 0005 §2.1). Expansion carries the real catalog ID or refuses.
//   - **Bounds.** A scope expands to at most MaxPairs pairs, and at most
//     Concurrency reviews are in flight at once. A large project cannot
//     turn one job into an unbounded fan-out of model calls.
//   - **Stopping.** A cancel stops the batch and Poll says so. A refusal
//     that ends the tenant's ability to make the *next* call — the
//     budget above all — stops the batch cleanly and reports what it
//     managed, because evidence already paid for is not thrown away to
//     report a code.
//
// Nothing here knows what a prompt is, and nothing here calls a
// provider: the model call is the layer's, which is Intelligence's,
// behind the Layer port. Every test in this package fakes that port, so
// a test that somehow reached a network would have to have been handed
// a real router — and the composition root is the only place that
// happens.
