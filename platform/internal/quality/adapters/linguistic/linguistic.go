// Package linguistic is the Quality context's adapter onto
// Intelligence: it runs the linguistic layer's model call and hands
// back the layer (RFC 0005 §3.8).
//
// The layer's rules live in `quality/layers` (the codes, the advisory
// severity, the identity of a finding); the model machinery lives in
// `intelligence` (the provider port, routing, the per-tenant budget,
// the versioned prompt, the constrained answer). This package is the
// seam, and it is the only place the two contexts meet: Quality names
// the vocabulary, Intelligence spends the money, and what comes back is
// a `domain.Finding` like every other layer's.
//
// It is the seam in the other direction too. A linguistic finding is
// computed by a job and only reported by a check (RFC 0005 §14
// decision 2), so nothing in `glossa check` reaches this package — the
// CLI has no path to it, and a caller that wanted one would have to
// import Intelligence into the command, which is the thing the decision
// forbids.
