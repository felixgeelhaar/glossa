// The visual layer (RFC 0005 §5): what a capture's probe pass measured
// in the page, reported like every other layer.
//
// The layer computes nothing itself. The measurements need live layout
// — `scrollWidth`, `getComputedStyle`, `document.fonts.check()` — which
// exists only while the page is open, so they are taken in the browser,
// in the product's CI, by `@klarlabs-studio/glossa-capture`'s probe pass. What is left
// here is the part that must not live in a browser: the identity of a
// finding (its fingerprint), where it is (the locus), and the rule that
// decides when one may be believed.
//
// That rule is the two-sighting rule of §5.2. A visual finding is a
// warning on first sighting and becomes eligible for error only when
// the same fingerprint appears in two consecutive captures of the same
// (route, viewport, locale). Headless Chrome's text metrics move with
// font availability, and scout can pass no extra Chrome flags (the gap
// filed in platform/README.md), so a single sighting is not evidence —
// and a check that goes red on a font that was installed on one runner
// and not the next is a check people turn off.

// VisualScope is one capture's (route, viewport, locale): the unit the
// two-sighting rule counts in. The same clipped button at two viewports
// is two sightings of two different things, because the two viewports
// lay the page out differently and only one of them may be wrong.

// Probed is one capture's probe findings, as the page wrote them: the
// `glossa.finding/v1` shape with no fingerprint (a browser has the key
// and not the catalog's message ID, so a fingerprint computed there
// would not be the one the server computes) and with the locus's route
// and capture left for the caller to fill.
//
// The message ID is the caller's too, and it is not optional: a caller
// that can resolve the key resolves it before promoting — Project.Identify
// in `glossa capture --check`, the upload itself at the capture ingest —
// because the fingerprint PromoteVisual mints is hashed over it.

// PromoteVisual seals one run's probe findings and applies the
// two-sighting rule to them, against what the previous run of each
// scope saw. It answers with the layer and with the sightings to
// remember for the next run.
//
// Every finding comes out as a warning. Promotion makes a finding
// *eligible* for error — it is what lets a policy rule
// (`{layer: visual, severity: error}`) reach it — and never an error by
// itself, so a project that says nothing about the visual layer is
// never failed by one (RFC 0005 §5.2).
//
// A fingerprint seen in more than one scope is reported once, with the
// highest sighting count any scope gave it: it is one problem, and the
// run that confirmed it anywhere confirmed it.
//
// The sightings that come back are this run's alone: a scope this run
// did not capture keeps no history, because two captures with a gap
// between them are not two consecutive captures of anything.
