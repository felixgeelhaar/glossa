// The literal text of a message, and how a finding points back into it.
//
// Four layers — style, length, locale and source — grade what a message
// *says* rather than what it declares, and all four have the same two
// problems. The first is that a message is a model and not a string: a
// select message has one pattern per variant, and a pattern is text,
// placeholders and markup interleaved. The second is that a finding's
// span is in bytes of the message *as it was authored*, which is the
// string a person edits, not the concatenation of its Text elements.
//
// So: scanning happens over the literal text, where `{$count}` is not a
// brace anybody typed and a markup element is not an angle bracket; and
// a span is resolved afterwards by locating the offending run in the
// authored text, when the caller carried it and the run is there to be
// found. A caller that kept only the model gets findings with no span,
// which is the honest answer — a span into a string nobody has is worse
// than none.

// Variant is one pattern of a message, as a layer reads it: its literal
// text and the variant keys that select it.
type Variant struct {
	// Keys names the variant ("one", "other"), joined by a space for a
	// multi-selector message. It is empty for a pattern message.
	Keys string
	// Text is the pattern's literal text, with placeholders and markup
	// removed.
	Text string

// nil message has none.
