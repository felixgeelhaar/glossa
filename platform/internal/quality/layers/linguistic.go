// The linguistic layer (RFC 0005 §3.8): the one layer a model decides.
//
// Like the visual layer, it computes nothing here. A model call is a
// job — explicit or over a batch, never a check (RFC 0005 §14
// decision 2) — and what is left in this package is the part that must
// not live wherever the call happens: the identity of a finding, its
// locus, its vocabulary, and the one rule the layer exists to keep.
//
// That rule is that a finding here is **advisory**. It is a warning,
// always, and a policy may not raise it (checkpolicy.AdvisoryLayers
// refuses the rule, and checkpolicy.Target clamps a decision that got
// through anyway). This layer's own contribution is narrower and
// blunter: it never mints anything but a warning, so no caller can hand
// the grader an error to clamp in the first place. A build does not
// fail on an opinion, so an opinion never arrives dressed as a fact.
//
// `meaning-divergence` folds in what intent §29 calls semantic QA. RFC
// 0005 §13 defers splitting the two into separate layers until there is
// eval evidence for the split, so there is one model-backed layer here
// and not two.

// The layer's codes. They are the whole vocabulary: the prompt lists
// exactly these, the answer schema constrains the model to them, and a
// note with any other code is a malformed answer, not a new code.

// not the catalog — so the locus arrives as far as the caller could
// fill it and NewLinguistic mints the identity from it. The caller
// resolves the message ID before it seals, for the reason Probed gives:
// the fingerprint is hashed over it, and a fingerprint over a key is
// not the one another surface computes for the same finding.

// emitted under a code no policy can select and no dashboard can name.

// version that has since been retired.
