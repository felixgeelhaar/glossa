// The quality summary (RFC 0005 §8): seven numbers per project and
// locale, and no more, because a dashboard nobody reads is worse than a
// check that fails.
//
// Everything here is computed from the owning context's own tables on
// read and cached for a minute. M4 adds no time-series store —
// `chronos` and the Insights context stay for M5 (§14 decision 7) — so
// the one trend is the findings-by-day rollup Quality keeps itself.
//
// The document is pivoted the way it is read: one ProjectHealth and one
// LocaleHealth per locale, each carrying the same seven fields, rather
// than seven lists a reader would have to join by locale code. A locale
// row also says which layers are *available* for it, so an unsupported
// layer never reads as a green one (intent §41).
//
// **A number that could not be computed is absent, never zero.** Every
// member of a health row is a pointer, nil where the number was not
// measured, and Unmeasured carries the name and the reason. Nothing
// here ever answers a question it could not ask: a port the deployment
// never wired, a permission the caller does not hold, an environment
// that has published nothing, a project nothing has ever checked — each
// of those leaves the number absent. A dashboard that reports 0 for
// "not measured" is a lie, and the two become indistinguishable the
