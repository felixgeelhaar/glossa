// The quality summary's sources (RFC 0005 §8).
//
// Five of the seven numbers belong to other contexts, and Quality reads
// every one of them through an application port of the context that
// owns it — never out of its tables (RFC 0002 §4). Each port is a
// question in Quality's own words; the adapter answers it with an
// ordinary authorized use case of the owning service, so the summary
// shows exactly what its caller could have read operation by operation
// through the API, and nothing more.
//
// Every port is optional. A deployment that does not wire one leaves
// its number **not measured**, which the summary says out loud instead
// of reporting a zero nobody computed.
