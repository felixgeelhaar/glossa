// Quality's daily housekeeping (RFC 0005 §2.2, §2.3, §13 wave 7). Two
// things accumulate, and neither of them is a finding:
//
//   - **Waivers that set a date.** `expires_at` stays optional — some
//     waivers are permanent decisions, and forcing a date makes people
//     pick one at random (§15 question 4, decided by the owner) — so
//     the sweep retires the ones that did set a date and leaves the
//     rest to the dashboard's staleness numbers. An expiry is
//     *recorded*, never deleted: the row stays with the moment it was
//     retired, exactly as a revoked waiver stays, because the reason
//     somebody wrote is the whole point of the mechanism.
//
//   - **Check runs past their retention.** They are kept 90 days
//     (domain.RunRetention), except the newest run of a ref, which
//     every dashboard, `listFindings` and the summary read whatever its
//     age. The findings go with their run; the history does not,
//     because the findings-by-day rollup (migration 0035) already holds
//     it a day at a time.
//
// Both halves run per tenant, in that tenant's own scope. Finding
// *which* tenants have work is the one thing that cannot: that is the
// Scanner, in system scope quality.sweep, which sees when a waiver
// expires and when a run started and nothing else at all (§10).

// sweepPrincipal is the background principal of the daily sweep. Its
// name is stable: it appears as the actor in logs.

// rest.

// deletes, so a project that has never been swept doesn't make one
// statement unbounded. The next day takes the rest.
