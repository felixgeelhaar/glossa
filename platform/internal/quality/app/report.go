// A check that ran somewhere else is recorded here (RFC 0005 §9): the
// create half of "check runs (create, read, list)". `glossa check` in a
// product's CI computes the layers against the project it already read,
// and posts what it found, so Studio's quality view, `listFindings`,
// the summary and the findings-by-day rollup see the runs that gate
// that product's builds. Without it, the surfaces stay empty for
// exactly the projects M4 targets.
//
// It is a fourth caller of RecordCheckRun, not a second use case: the
// capture ingest (§5.1), the linguistic job (§3.8) and the write-time
// job all end in the same store call, with the same waiver application
// and the same day rollup. What this one adds is what a *reporter*
// cannot be trusted with, and the two members it completes are the
// reason it exists at all rather than being a passthrough:
//
//   - The **fingerprint** is computed by domain.New, over the catalog
//     message ID the key resolved to. A reporter has the key; the
//     server has the catalog. A print minted over a key is not the one
//     the waiver list, the findings list and the pull-request check
//     compute for the same finding, so every waiver against it would
//     silently stop applying. ReportedFinding therefore has no
//     fingerprint field at all — it is not a value the ingest ignores,
//     it is a value the ingest cannot be handed.
//   - The **severity and the verdict** are the policy's. The reporter
//     says what its layer emitted; domain.Evaluate decides what that is
//     worth in this locale, this namespace and this environment, drops
//     what a rule switched off, and clamps an advisory layer back to
//     warning. There is no conclusion and no counts on the way in: a
//     caller that could assert those could declare its own build green.

// ReportedLocus is as much of a finding's locus as a reporter knows.
//
// It is domain.Locus minus Message, Capture and Region. Message is
// resolved here from Key, for the reason above. Capture and Region are
// the capture ingest's to mint — only the server that gave a capture
// its ID can pair a region with it — and a check run is of a catalog,
// not of a screenshot.
