// The visual layer's findings arrive with a capture (RFC 0005 §5.1):
// the probe pass measures them live in the product's CI, while the page
// is open and `scrollWidth`, `getComputedStyle`, `document.fonts.check()`
// and `explain()` still exist, and uploads them with the capture. The
// server validates them and re-measures nothing — it cannot.
//
// Two members of the finding the page could not write, the ingest
// completes here, and both are the reason this is a use case rather
// than a passthrough:
//
//   - The **fingerprint** is computed by domain.Fingerprint, over the
//     catalog message ID where the key resolved to one. A browser has
//     the key and never the ID, so a fingerprint minted in the page
//     would not be the one the server computes for the same finding,
//     and every waiver against it would silently stop applying.
//   - **locus.capture** is minted here: the probe names its region as
//     `r_<index>` and the capture it is on has just been given an ID.
//     The finding schema pairs the two (`region` is only valid beside a
//     `capture`), and only the server can pair them.
//
// Everything else is what the page wrote.

// CaptureFinding is one visual finding of one capture, as Context hands
// it over: the probe's, with the key already resolved.
