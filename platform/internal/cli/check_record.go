// `glossa check` puts its run on the record (RFC 0005 §9,
// `createCheckRun`).
//
// M4's exit criterion is `glossa check` gating CI in every dogfood
// product. Until the run is recorded, that gate is invisible
// everywhere else: Studio's quality view, `listFindings`, the project
// summary and the findings-by-day rollup stay empty for exactly the
// projects the milestone targets, because nothing outside the platform
// binary ever wrote a finding. Recording closes that, and it closes it
// without a product changing anything — the same command, the same CI
// token, the same permissions.
//
// **Default in CI, off on a laptop, `--record` either way.** The
// default has to serve the exit criterion without a new line in a
// workflow file, so in CI it records. It is deliberately *not* the
// default everywhere else:
//
//   - A developer running `glossa check` in a loop while editing a
//     message would post a run every few seconds, and each one becomes
//     the project's newest — the run every dashboard, `listFindings`
//     and the summary read. The team would be looking at one laptop's
//     half-finished branch instead of at what CI last decided.
//   - A local run may carry local overrides: `glossa.yaml`'s `check:`
//     block, `--fail-on`, `--require-complete`, `--layer`. The
//     pull-request check ignores all of them on purpose (RFC 0005 §4.2,
//     §14 decision 3), so what a local run computed is not what the
//     project's policy computes.
//   - Recording is a write. Silently writing to the shared record on a
//     command a developer reaches for to answer a question about their
//     own working copy is not a default anyone asked for.
//
// What the server does with what is sent is the other half of why this
// is safe: it computes every fingerprint itself over the catalog
// message the key resolved to, re-grades every severity against the
// project's stored policy and reaches its own conclusion. An overridden
// local run cannot therefore put an overridden verdict on the record —
// only the findings, which the project's policy then grades.
//
// `--offline` never records, and neither does a run that fell back to
// the cached policy because the server was out of reach: there is no
// server to record to, and a run graded against a cache is not the
// project's verdict.
