// `glossa check` and the project's waivers (RFC 0005 §2.3, §12.4).
//
// Both halves existed and neither was joined to the other: the CLI
// could create a waiver whose fingerprint provably matches the server's
// finding (cmd_waive_test.go), and the server applied waivers when it
// recorded a run. `glossa check` did neither — it never fetched them and
// never applied them — so a waiver changed the pull request's counts and
// not the terminal's, and the two surfaces disagreed about a decision
// somebody had already made and written a reason for.
//
// These tests are therefore of the command and not of the matcher: they
// waive through the CLI and then read what `glossa check` says.

// theFinding is the one finding of a `pushed` project's check: de has
// nothing in it and the default policy fails on that.
// theFinding is the fixture's missing German translation — the error
// these tests waive.
//
// It selects rather than taking the only finding, because the fixture's
// own source copy legitimately draws warnings from the layers that read
// it (`"Welcome"` is one word with no description). Asserting a count
// here would make this test fail whenever a layer starts finding
// something new, which is the opposite of what it is about: what is
// under test is that a waiver moves *this* finding to `waived` and out
// of the error count.
