// Where the two-sighting rule's state lives (RFC 0005 §5.2).
//
// The rule needs one thing: what the *previous* capture of each (route,
// viewport, locale) found. `glossa capture --check` keeps it next to the
// policy cache, in the workspace the capture runs in — which in the
// product's CI is the workspace of the job that captures, so the two
// consecutive captures the rule talks about are two consecutive runs of
// that job.
//
// It is a record, not a source of truth. Losing it costs one promotion:
// every fingerprint is a first sighting again and every visual finding
// is a warning, which is the safe direction. That is why a record that
// cannot be read is not an error — unlike the policy cache, which is a
// run's grading and whose loss must stop the run.
//
// It follows that a CI job with a throwaway workspace promotes nothing:
// every run is a first sighting, every visual finding is a warning, and
// a policy that raises the visual layer to error never bites. Caching
// `.glossa/` between runs of the capture job is what a product does
// about that locally. The other answer is the server's: uploaded
// captures carry their findings per build (RFC 0005 §13 wave 4's
// Capture API), and a check that reads them from there reads them
// already promoted. This file is what lets `glossa capture --check`
// decide the same way with nothing uploaded.

// sightingsPath is where the last capture's fingerprints are kept,
// relative to glossa.yaml.

// It names the server, the project and the application it was written
// for: another application's captures are not this one's sightings, and
// a record copied between checkouts is not evidence of anything.
