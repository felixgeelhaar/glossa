// `glossa capture --check` (RFC 0005 §13 wave 4): capture and check in
// one command.
//
// It is the same check `glossa check` runs — the same layers, the same
// policy, the same document, the same five exit codes — with one layer
// more, the visual one, which only a command that has just had a
// browser open can contribute. Nothing about it is a second check: the
// run is built by the same functions, so a product's CI that captures
// and checks reaches the verdict the terminal reaches.
//
// The command is split in two halves around the capture itself.
// startCheck runs first, before Chrome starts, because the probe pass
// measures against the policy's thresholds and because a run that
// cannot resolve its policy must say so before it captures forty pages,
// not after. finishCheck runs last, when there are captures to promote
// and grade.

// captureCheck is the check half of a `glossa capture --check` run.
