// Package domain is Workflow's model (RFC 0006 §2): the
// glossa.workflow/v1 document, the closed vocabulary its charts are
// written in, compiling a definition through statekit.FromJSON with
// lint-on-save, immutable versions, and bindings.
//
// The package is pure. Guards are functions of a Step — the event that
// arrived and a read-only snapshot of its subject — and actions record
// Effects on it. Carrying an effect out (assigning, asking for an
// approval, setting a review state) is the instance runner's, through
// the owning context's ports and as the actor whose event caused the
// transition (§2.5); nothing here can approve, write or call anything.
