// scope and the publish toolset.
//
// They are the thinnest tools in this package on purpose. A release is
// the one thing in Glossa that reaches production, and every rule about
// it — which review states an environment's policy admits, whether a
// branch release may be promoted, the completeness gate that answers
// `policy_not_met`, the immutability of a published release, the
// deployment history a rollback walks — belongs to the Release context.
// None of it is restated here, and a tool that policed a release itself
// would be the second implementation RFC 0005 §7.1 forbids.
//
// What is *not* here is as deliberate: no environment creation, no
// policy edit, no delivery keys, no release deletion, and no `force`.
// Forcing past the publish gate takes an audited reason and is a
// person's decision, for the same reason a translation an agent writes
// always enters review.
