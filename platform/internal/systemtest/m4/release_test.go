// The release gate (RFC 0005 §12.5): publishing to `production` with
// `fr` incomplete fails with `policy_not_met`; the forced publish
// succeeds and writes an audit entry with its reason.
//
// The environment's requirement is policy v3's, which lists `fr` among
// the locales production must ship complete — and the fixture is seeded
// with three French translations that were never written, so the
// requirement is not met.

// approveFor approves every translation a locale has, the way a
// reviewer would. A release ships what the environment's review
// requirement makes eligible, and nothing a token pushed is approved:
// `translations.review` is in no scope's permission set, because review
// is a human decision. So the three French translations that were never
// written are the only thing standing between this project and a
// production release, which is what §12.5 is about.
