-- Tenant scope (db.TenantTx): RLS limits every statement to the current

-- A waiver accepts a finding by its fingerprint, with a reason that the
-- column, the domain and the API all require (RFC 0005 §2.3). It never
-- deletes anything: the finding it accepts is still computed, still
-- listed and still counted, at severity `waived`.

-- name: UpsertWaiver :one
-- Waiving a finding a second time is not a second waiver: the partial
-- unique index allows one live waiver per fingerprint and reach, so a
-- repeat restates the reason, the expiry and the source revision it is
-- made against. Revoking frees the slot, and the revoked row stays as
-- history.
