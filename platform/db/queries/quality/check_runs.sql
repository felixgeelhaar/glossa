-- A check run is one evaluation of one ref against one policy version
-- (RFC 0005 §2.2 rule 3). Every surface reads the stored run rather than
-- recomputing it, so these queries are the only place a run is written.

-- name: InsertCheckRun :exec
-- A run and its verdict, written once. The counts are what the run
-- concluded, with the waivers that were live while it graded; nothing
-- rewrites them afterwards, because a verdict is history.
