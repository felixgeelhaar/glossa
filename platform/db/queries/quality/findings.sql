-- Tenant scope (db.TenantTx): RLS limits every statement to the current
-- tenant.
--
-- A finding row is immutable (migration 0027): a run is one evaluation,
-- and the next evaluation writes new rows rather than editing the last
-- one's. There is no UPDATE here and the table is not granted one.
--
-- Severity is stored as the layer emitted it — `error` or `warning`, and
-- never `waived`. A waiver is not a property of a finding but of the
-- project (RFC 0005 §2.3), it can be written after the run that found
-- the finding and it dies when the source revision moves, so whether a
-- finding is waived is decided on *read*, by the lateral join below,
-- against the waivers that are live now. Baking it into the row would
-- lose the severity the layer emitted, and a revoked waiver could never
-- give it back. What the run itself concluded is kept, in the run's own
-- counts.

-- name: InsertFindings :exec
-- A batch of a run's findings. uuid.Nil stands for an absent ID, 0 for
-- an absent line or column, -1 for an absent span offset or source
-- revision, and '' for absent JSON.

-- name: ListRunFindings :many
-- A page of a run's findings, graded against the waivers that are live
-- now, in a stable order: errors, then warnings, then the waived, and
-- within each by layer, locale, message key and id. The order key is
-- byte-ordered ("C") and unique, and it is both what the rows are
-- ordered by and what the cursor carries, so a page never shifts.
--
-- The lateral picks at most one waiver — a branch-scoped one before a
-- project-scoped one, because it is the more specific reach — and picks
-- none once the source revision the finding was computed against has
-- moved past the one the waiver was made against: the German somebody
-- waived is not the German that now ships, so the finding comes back.

-- A capture's findings are read on their own, not through the project's

-- which the join carries, so a branch-scoped waiver applies here for
-- the same branch it applies for anywhere else.
