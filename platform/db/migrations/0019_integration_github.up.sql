-- 0019 — GitHub installations, Git connections and the webhook inbox
-- (RFC 0004 §6.1, §6.2).
--
-- The App itself is platform configuration (an App ID, a private key, a
-- webhook secret and OAuth credentials in one Kubernetes Secret, §14.1);
-- nothing of it is stored here. What is stored is the link between an
-- installation GitHub made and the tenant that claimed it, which of that
-- installation's repositories feed which projects, and the deliveries
-- GitHub has sent us but we have not processed yet.
--
-- Three rules shape the tables:
--
--   * An installation maps to exactly one tenant. The uniqueness on
--     GitHub's installation ID is therefore global, not per tenant: a
--     second tenant claiming the same installation hits the index and is
--     refused (`installation_already_claimed`). The index says nothing
--     about who holds it, so nothing leaks across the boundary.
--   * Repositories are keyed by their numeric ID, never by name, so a
--     rename or a transfer does not break a connection. One repository
--     can feed several projects, one per monorepo path — hence the
--     uniqueness on (repository_id, path) rather than repository_id.
--   * A delivery is stored and acknowledged, then processed by a worker.
--     Its row is tenantless until the installation resolves and moves to
--     the tenant afterwards, so the endpoint can write it before any
--     tenant is known. The payload is dropped once the delivery is
--     processed; the delivery ID stays for the replay window (7 days),
--     which is exactly what makes a duplicate a no-op.
--
-- Install intents hold the round trip together. The RFC calls for a
-- signed state bound to tenant, person and expiry; a random, unguessable
-- state whose SHA-256 is stored is that and more, because it is also
-- single-use and unforgeable rather than merely unaltered. The state
-- itself is never stored, only its hash, as with the sign-in links.
