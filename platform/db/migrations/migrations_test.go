// TestTheStreamLoads is the cheapest guard there is on one migration
// stream shared by every bounded context (RFC 0002 §6): two contexts
// developed side by side can each claim the same NNNN, and
// golang-migrate then refuses the whole source rather than the one
// file — the server fails at startup, before a single migration runs,
// and every context goes down with it. No database, no build tag: a
// number taken twice is caught by `go test ./...`.
